# EulerProject
PHP code for answer for Euler Project questions
Project Euler (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a series of computational 
problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The project attracts adults and students 
interested in mathematics and computer programming. Since its creation in 2001 by Colin Hughes, 
Project Euler has gained notability and popularity worldwide. It includes over 550 problems, 
with a new one added every weekend (except during the summer). Problems are of varying difficulty
but each is solvable in less than a minute using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered 
computer. Problems can be sorted on difficulty. A forum specific to each question may be viewed 
after the user has correctly answered the given question. As of July 2016 Project Euler has about 
611,200 users from all over the world (who solved at least one problem).

Participants can track their progress through achievement levels based on the number of problems 
solved. A new level is reached for every 25 problems solved. Special awards exist for solving 
special combinations of problems, for instance there is an award for solving fifty prime numbered 
problems. A special Eulerians level exists to track achievement based on the fastest fifty solvers 
of recent problems so that newer members can compete without solving older problems.

A subset of the Project Euler problems was used in an APL programming contest.
